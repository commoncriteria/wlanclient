    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      
      The scope of the Wireless LAN (WLAN) Client <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> is to describe the security functionality of a Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) Client in terms of [<abbr linkend="CC"/>] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> is intended for use with the following <abbr linkend="Base-PP"/>s: <h:ul>
        <h:li>General Purpose Operating System (GPOS) Protection Profile, Version 4.2.1</h:li>
        <h:li>Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) Protection Profile, Version 3.1</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <h:p/> These <abbr linkend="Base-PP"/>s are valid because a WLAN Client is
      a part of either a commercial operating system that can be installed on a general-purpose computer or an operating system that runs on a purpose-built mobile device.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
     
     This document specifies Security Functional Requirements for a WLAN Client. The TOE defined
     by this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> is the WLAN Client, a component executing on a client machine (often referred to as
     a "remote access client"). The TOE establishes a secure wireless tunnel between the client
     device and a WLAN Access System through which all data will traverse.
     <h:p/>
      A WLAN Client allows remote users to use client machines to establish wireless communication
      with a private network through a WLAN Access System. IP packets passing between the
      private network and a WLAN Client are encrypted. The WLAN Client protects the
      data between itself and the private network, protection the confidentiality and integrity 
      of data in transit, even though it traverses a wireless connection.
      The focus of the Security Functional Requirements in this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> is on the following fundamental
      aspects of a WLAN Client:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Authentication of the WLAN Client;</h:li>
        <h:li>Authentication of the Authentication Servert;</h:li>
        <h:li>Cryptographic protection of data in transit; and</h:li>
        
        <!-- SME: don't know what specifically this refers to, unsure if we should keep as-is, change somehow, or remove altogether -->
        <h:li>Implementation of services.</h:li>
        
      </h:ul>
      The WLAN Client establishes an 802.11 tunnel between the client device and the network
      infrastructure using IEEE 802.1X with EAP-TLS for authentication. It performs mutual
      authentication to an AS in the private network as part of the EAP-TLS exchange. The EAP-TLS
      exchange uses certificates for mutual authentication. The WLAN Client examines the machine
      certificate transmitted from the AS, checks its validity, and ensures the certificate is signed by a
      trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The AS will authenticate the WLAN Client certificate at the
      same time. When the EAP-TLS exchange completes successfully, the network allows the WLAN
      Client to finish establishing a secure communication tunnel to the private network. The WLAN
      Client sets up an encrypted, authenticated channel to the WLAN Access System using a 4 way
      handshake, as specified in IEEE 802.11. Once the channel is established, all communication
      between the WLAN Client to the WLAN Access System is encrypted with AES in CCMP mode and
      optionally AES is GCMP mode, as specified in <cite linkend="bib80211"/>.
      
      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The WLAN Client (Figure 1), as defined by this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/>, is a component executing on a remote access
        client machine. Note the client is depicted as just a small portion of the WLAN client "machine."
        As such, the TOE must rely heavily on the TOE’s operational environment (host platform,
        network stack, and operating system) for its execution domain and its proper usage. The TOE
        will rely on the IT environment to address much of the security functionality related to
        administrative functions.

    This PP-Module is written to address the situation when an entity desires wireless access to a private
    network. To allow access to the private network, the entity (machine) must be authenticated
    before a secure communications channel can be established. The TOE is the entity that seeks to
    be authenticated and be given access to services offered by the protected network and is the
    Supplicant in the IEEE 802.1X framework.

              however that its scope is expanded to include keys and key material that are used by the TSF

              destruction function is at least partially implemented by the underlying platform as opposed to
              the WLAN Client itself. For the purposes of this requirement, it is sufficient for the TOE to invoke
              the correct underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization—it does not imply that
              the TOE has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are zeroized.
              <h:p/>
              Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and passwords) must be
              zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure or modification of security critical data.
              <h:p/>
              The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for plaintext key or CSP
              (i.e., any storage, such as memory buffers, that is included in the path of such data) upon the
              transfer of the key or CSP to another location.
              <h:p/>
              Additionally, although IEEE 802.11-2012 does not specify PMK lifetimes (described in IEEE
              802.11-2012 Section 11.6.1.3) for WLAN Clients, these lifetimes should be limited, and the
              PMKSA cleared, in such a way as to prevent continued use of the same PMK for more than 24
              hours. Thus, for PMKs, “when no longer needed” is after 24 hours.

  <!-- Remove this section if an Entropy Assessment is not needed -->
  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <h:br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <h:br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <h:br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <h:br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
